Tufte is a port of the "scruffy"[1] plotting library for Perl 6.

It is a work in progress (ie not yet done much).

== SYNOPSIS:

    given Tufte::Graph.new {
        .title = "Sample Line Graph";
        .renderer = Tufte::Renderer::Standard.new;

        .add(:line, 'Example', [20, 100, 70, 30, 106]);

        .render(:to<line_test.svg>);
        .render(:width(300), :height(200),
                :to<line_test.png>, :as<png>);
    }

copying their code, we have to adapt either the same license, or an
intersection of the MIT license and Artistic License 2.0.
